This is just the portable keyboard file I use when I have to work on another linux.

You don't need root permission to use it, but be carefull: **this will orverride all your keyboard behaviour !**

If you are curious, there is also my layout file (or "symbols" file) *beprog*

This layout is based on the [b√©po](https://bepo.fr) official layout
