# Beprog

The name of my unique layout.

French layout (azerty) is a mess, in particular for programming.

I can't switch to qwerty, because I need a lot of french special characters to write the words in that language.
example : 
	C'est Noël, un heureux évenement. Où êtes vous ?


So I created my custom layout !


## Linux

I create my layout file with X11, you can see what there is in it.

There is a linux/setkb.sh file to test it.

You don't need root permission to use it, but be carefull: **this will orverride all your keyboard behaviour !**

If you are curious, there is also my layout file (or "symbols" file) *beprog*


## Windows

The Windows implementation is just a ahk (auto-hot-key) script compiled to .exe and a text file representing the layout.

To enable/disable layout, just hit windows+space

## Inspiration

This layout is based on the [bépo](https://bepo.fr) official layout
